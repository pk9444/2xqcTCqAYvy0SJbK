# VOICE CLONING AND FAKE AUDIO DETECTION 

## PHASE 1 - VOICE CLONING SYSTEM (VCS)

### CONTEXT 

The client is a tech company working in the Cyber Security industry. They developed end-to-end products and services that ensure the customers security using data driven technologies to understand whether audio and video media is authentic or fake/synthetic.

### GOALS

- Build a VCS (Voice Cloning System) that takes real/authentic audio samples, applies signal transformations, and generates their synthetic clones.
- Develop a FAD (Fake Audio Detection) using a ground truth audio dataset, that uses Machine Learning to detect whether the audio is fake or not.

### SUCCESS METRICS
- Word Error Rate (WER) for automatic evaluation of the VCS.
- Speaker classification accuracy to assess the performance of the generated audioâ€™s target speaker.
- Classification metrics like F-1 Score via positive labels coming from the groundtruth dataset and negative labels generated by the VCS.

### DATA DESCRIPTION

For this project, we will be leveraging the following two datasets: 

- TIMIT dataset - contains speech data for acoustic-phonetic studies and for the development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition systems. TIMIT contains a total of 6300 sentences, 10 sentences spoken by each of 630 speakers from 8 major dialect regions of the United States. Our VCS will create 5 clones per speaker id.

- CommonVoice dataset - corpus of speech data read by users on the Common Voice website (https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/), and based upon text from a number of public domain sources like user submitted blog posts, old books, movies, and other public speech corpora. Its primary purpose is to enable the training and testing of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Link - [https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets]

## PHASE 2 - FAKE AUDIO DETECTION (FAD)

### OBJECTIVE

- To develop a FAD (Fake Audio Detection) using a ground truth CommonVoice audio dataset, consolidate it with the extracted and labelled TIMIT audio samples, and build a ML model that detects whether an audio is fake or real.
